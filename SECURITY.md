# Security Policy

Only the current major version supports security updates. I will yank all vulnerable versions prior to the current major version.

Report vulnerabilities to me, Blake Naccarato, at blake.naccarato@gmail.com. I will follow whatever vulnerability disclosure policy that you suggest.
