# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the current major version supports security updates. I will yank all vulnerable versions prior to the current major version.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Report vulnerabilities to me, Blake Naccarato, at blake.naccarato@gmail.com

I will follow whatever vulnerability disclosure policy that you suggest.
